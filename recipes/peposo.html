    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A very old Italian dish from pre-Columbian Tuscany, Peposo dell'Impruneta was made by Tuscan tile workers who
        heavily peppered their
        poor cuts of beef and sealed them in clay jars with red wine, left to cook in the hot sun for hours. Slow
        cooking in lots of wine,
        pepper, and herbs will turn any cut of meat into a delicacy!
    </p>
    <p>
        Short ribs are recommended for this recipe, although just about any cut of beef with bones will work. You might
        think we are using
        too much pepper, but the bold presence of big pepper in combination with the subtle wine and herbs are what
        makes this dish unique.
