    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A beautiful Italian pasta sauce that has its roots in Bari, Italy. This is a very rich, dark,
        and meaty sauce. Traditionally made with lamb necks, we can also substitute beef, pork, as
        well as various types of sausage. Using a cut or two of meat with some nice bones improves the
        flavor.

    <p>
        Our sauce is relatively simple, we will be using various canned tomato products instead of making
        it ourselves the old fashioned way. Cooking this sauce in a regular pot over the stove will need
        four or five hours to finish. Alternatively, if you have a pressure cooker, we can speed the cook
        time up to around 90 minutes. The pressure cooker also dramatically improves flavor in my opinion.
